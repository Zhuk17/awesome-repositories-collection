### Translation System

This repository uses **automated translation** via GitHub Actions:

3. Automated translations will be regenerated on next `README.md` update

### Testing Translations Locally

```bash
# Set up Python environment
pip install openai anthropic requests python-dotenv pyyaml

# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# Run translation script
export SOURCE_LANG=en
export TARGET_LANGS=ru,zh-CN
python scripts/translate_readmes.py
```
